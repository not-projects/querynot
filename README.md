> **Query your data, not your patience.**

QueryNot is a planned local-first desktop SQL client focused on a fast, calm, and dependable workflow for working with databases.

## Project Status

QueryNot is in pre-alpha development. The repository is establishing its product and engineering foundations; it does not yet contain a usable application or a committed database-support matrix.

The planned application stack is:

- Rust for native database and application services
- Tauri 2 for the desktop shell
- Svelte and TypeScript for the user interface

## Product Direction

QueryNot is being designed around a small set of principles:

- **Fast by default:** Opening a connection, writing SQL, running it, and inspecting results should feel immediate.
- **Simple without being limiting:** Common work should stay obvious while advanced tools remain available when needed.
- **Local-first:** Connection profiles, query history, and workspace state should remain on the user's machine unless a future feature explicitly says otherwise.
- **Safe around data:** Credentials, destructive statements, exports, logs, and diagnostics require deliberate handling.
- **Desktop-native:** Database work belongs in a focused application, not another crowded browser tab.

Specific database engines and the first release's feature scope will be selected during product design rather than promised prematurely here.
